* Cleaned up some documentation
* Cache directory will now default to system temp directory in PHP >= 5.2.1
* Added a protected 'debug' method to base class (as well as many calls to it), for cleaner handling of diagnostic messages
* As an effort to minimize source file size, converted space-indending to tab-indenting.  This will likely make for some horrendous diffs, but it trimmed down filesizes rather significantly.
