VCI - The Version Control Interface
===================================

VCI is an object-oriented interface that makes it easy to interact with many
different version-control systems, while only having to write your code once.

INSTALLATION

To install VCI, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

REQUIREMENTS

  When you run "make test" it will tell you if you are missing any
dependencies. If you want to see what the dependencies are without
having to run make, you can look at the contents of Makefile.PL,
where the dependencies should be fairly clear.
