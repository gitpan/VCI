VCI - The Version Control Interface
===================================

VCI is an object-oriented interface that makes it easy to interact with many
different version-control systems, while only having to write your code once.

INSTALLATION

To install VCI, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

REQUIREMENTS

  When you run "perl Build.PL" it will tell you if you are missing any
dependencies. If you want to see what the dependencies are without
having to run Build.PL, you can look at the contents of Build.PL,
where the dependencies should be fairly clear.
