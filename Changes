0.3.1 Dec 3, 2007
    New Features:
        - Repository has a root_project to represent the idea that in some
          VCSes, the entire repository can be looked at as one Project.
        - FileContainer has contents_history_recursive, which gives a History
          for the contents of that directory and the contents of all its
          directories, etc.
    
    Optimizations:
        - Calling Bzr::Project::history should now be much faster,
          particularly on large projects.
        - Calling Svn::Project::get_commit and Svn::Committable::history
          should be faster, in most situations.
    
    Bug Fixes:
        - Make the bzr tests work with modern versions of bzr. (Fix the
          parsing of the --version output.)
        - History::union was sorting by revision number instead of by time.
        - Getting the contents of an Svn directory would sometimes fail.
          Thanks to Sam Vilain for help with the fix!
        - Cvs always said the timezone of commits was the local timezone.
          Now it's always UTC, to be consistent on all machines.

0.2.1 Fri, Sep 17, 2007
    - We now explicitly require Perl 5.6.0, which is what
      Perl::MinimumVersion says we require. No promises that all our
      dependencies work with 5.6.0, though.
    
    New Features:
        - Added File::content, which allows you to get the actual raw content
          of a file at its particular revision.
        - Added File::content_size, which allows you to get the size of the
          file in bytes at its particular revision.
        - Added Project::head_revision, which returns the revision ID
          that represents "head" in the Project.
        - You can now specify "revision" to get_file to get a particular
          revision of that file.
    
    API Changes:
        - Project::get_commit now takes named parameters instead of a single
          positional parameter.
        - Project::get_history_by_time no longer has an "at" argument. (Use
          get_commit(time => 'blah') instead.)
        - Svn's FileOrDirectory is now *both* a VCI::Abstract::File and a
          VCI::Abstract::Directory, instead of being neither.
    
    Optimizations:
        - Hg's File::history should now be much faster, as gets the
          information directly from Hg instead of building it from the
          Project's History.
    
    Bug Fixes:
        - Sometimes Cvs's File::content was including extra garbage at the
          end of the actual file content.
        - Specifying a value greater than 1 for "debug" in VCI->connect
          was throwing an error.
        - Cvs wasn't dying correctly when a command failed.
        - File::is_executable wasn't correctly specified as being Bool.
        - Svn should now correctly delete temp files created by
          Commit::as_diff after build_as_diff returns.

0.1.2 Tue, Sep 11, 2007
    - Added tests for Committable ::history, ::first_revision,
      and ::last_revision.
    - Committable was always returning a Bzr::History instead of the
      correct History object.
    
    Hg:
        - History was in reverse order.
        - Commit::contents would fail if there were no changes to any files
          in the commit.
        - Files in Commit ::added, ::modified, ::removed, and ::contents
          didn't have their "revision" and "time" set.
    
    Svn:
        -Commit ::last_revision and ::first_revision were broken.

0.1.1 Mon, Sep 10, 2007
    New Features:
        - Commit objects now have an as_diff accessor, which allows you to
          get that particular commit as a "diff" from the VCS. This adds
          a requirement of Text::Diff::Parser 0.07.
    
    API Changes:
        - get_path, get_file, and get_directory now take a single named
          argument, "path", instead of a single un-named argument.
    
    Bugs Fixed:
        - Added tests for all the drivers, which fixed a lot of bugs. In short,
          don't use any version of VCI before this one.
    
    For VCI Developers:
        - If you set the VCI_TEST_DEBUG environment variable, it will be
          passed as the "debug" argument to VCI->connect, allowing you to
          see more information from the driver about what's going on in the
          test.
        - You can set VCI_REMOTE_TESTS = 1 in your environment to run
          tests that involve accessing machines over the Internet.

0.0.3 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Svn history was broken when the repo history contained copied items.

0.0.2 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Bzr's history and contents were broken.
    - Svn's history was broken.
    - Git driver had some debug code left in that was breaking history.

0.0.1 Tue, Aug 28, 2007
    - Support for CVS
    - Test::Warn was missing from build_requires
    - Cleaned up documentation
    - Committables now can never be created with just time and no revision.
