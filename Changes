0.1.0_1 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Added "as_diff" to VCI::Abstract::Commit, and implemented it in all
      drivers. This allows you to get the actual changes done during
      the commit both as a raw diff from the VCS and as an object
      representing that diff.
    - Repository objects now fix "root" to end with a slash (if it doesn't
      already) on most VCSes, and fix it to *not* end with a slash on
      CVS.
    - Slightly improved debug output for Bzr.
