0.1.0_4 Fri, Sep 7, 2007
    - This release will probably be released as 0.1.1 in a few days,
      with a few POD improvements, unless there are terrible test failures
      that I don't know about.
    - Added tests for Hg, which found and fixed several bugs, listed lower
      in these notes.
    - We now require Text::Diff::Parser 0.07 which fixes bugs that affect us.
    - In Project, get_path, get_file, and get_directory now take named
      parameters instead of positional parameters, to prepare for future
      API improvements.

    Tests:
        - You can set VCI_TEST_DEBUG = 1 in the environment to have VCI
          connect with "debug" turned on during tests.
        - Set VCI_REMOTE_TESTS to 1 in the environment to run tests that
          involve accessing things across the Internet.
          
    Hg:
        - If you had a url like http://domain.com/repos/ for your Hg repo,
          Project names would look like "repos/project" instead of just
          "project".
        - Repository::projects returned an extra project that had an
          empty name.
        - Slashes at the start of a project name will be stripped, now.
        - Getting the contents of any directory other than the root_directory
          wasn't working.
        - Sometimes Committable objects would die when asked for their time,
          in certain timezones.
        - Commit::added, Commit::modified, and Commit::removed didn't work
          at all.
        - Messages had "<br/>" included in them, often.

0.1.0_3 Wed, Sep 3, 2007
    - The XML output format of bzr-xmloutput changed as of revision 18 of
      that plugin. The Bzr driver now supports both the old and the new
      format.
    - Calling Bzr::Repository->projects would sometimes fail because
      Repository.pm wasn't using VCI::VCS::Bzr::Project.
    - Tests were always failing because they weren't properly checking
      for non-perl-module prerequisites.

0.1.0_2 Mon, Sep 3, 2007
    - 0.1.0_1 was completely broken for several drivers (couldn't connect
      to a Repository).
    - Various fixes to Diffs in various drivers (compared to 0.1.0_1).
    - Project objects now remove trailing and starting forward-slashes
      from their names when they are initialized. So "/project/" will be the
      same as "project".
    - Various POD fixes.
    - Doing "./Build dist" will now always run tests before building the
      distribution. This is necessary because running the tests properly
      sets up t/repos/ for distribution.
    - Added tests for Cvs, Svn, Git, and Bzr, which caused a lot of re-arch
      and various bug fixes:
    
    Svn:
        - Support for local repositories, including relative paths.
        - "time" on objects from get_path, get_file, and get_directory
          was wrong. (Svn returns microseconds and we were interpreting
          them as seconds.)
        - The 'R' action is now interepreted as the file being modified,
          not added and then deleted.
        - Properly strip the final newline from Commit::message.
        - Copied/moved files now handled correctly (and how they are
          handled is better documented).
        - File and Directory objects from other Projects won't show up
          in your Project's Commit objects.
    
    Cvs:
        - Support for local repositories, including relative paths.
        - Repository now supports "projects".
        - File and Directory objects now return the correct time if gotten
          from get_path, get_file, or get_directory.
        - We weren't passing the "-u" argument to cvsps, so the History
          wasn't being updated if there was a new commit to the repository
          since the very first time anybody ever called "history" on this
          project.
    
    Git:
        - Calling "contents" on a versioned Directory now correctly returns
          the contents of that Directory at that time in history.
        - Commit::message was always returning an empty string. It now
          correctly returns the message.
        - File objects now return their most recent revision instead of
          'HEAD' if you got them from get_path or get_file.
        - Support for relative paths to local repos.
        - Repository::projects now also detects "bare" repositories.
    
    Bzr:
        - Commit:message no longer has an extra space at the start or an
          extra newline at the end.

0.1.0_1 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Added "as_diff" to VCI::Abstract::Commit, and implemented it in all
      drivers. This allows you to get the actual changes done during
      the commit both as a raw diff from the VCS and as an object
      representing that diff.
    - Repository objects now fix "root" to end with a slash (if it doesn't
      already) on most VCSes, and fix it to *not* end with a slash on
      CVS.
    - Slightly improved debug output for Bzr.

0.0.3 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Svn history was broken when the repo history contained copied items.

0.0.2 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Bzr's history and contents were broken.
    - Svn's history was broken.
    - Git driver had some debug code left in that was breaking history.

0.0.1 Tue, Aug 28, 2007
    - Support for CVS
    - Test::Warn was missing from build_requires
    - Cleaned up documentation
    - Committables now can never be created with just time and no revision.

0.0.0_1 Mon, Aug 27, 2007
    - Initial release, supporting Bzr, Svn, Hg, and Git
