0.1.2 Tue, Sep 11, 2007
    - Added tests for Committable ::history, ::first_revision,
      and ::last_revision.
    - Committable was always returning a Bzr::History instead of the
      correct History object.
    
    Hg:
        - History was in reverse order.
        - Commit::contents would fail if there were no changes to any files
          in the commit.
        - Files in Commit ::added, ::modified, ::removed, and ::contents
          didn't have their "revision" and "time" set.
    
    Svn:
        -Commit ::last_revision and ::first_revision were broken.

0.1.1 Mon, Sep 10, 2007
    New Features:
        - Commit objects now have an as_diff accessor, which allows you to
          get that particular commit as a "diff" from the VCS. This adds
          a requirement of Text::Diff::Parser 0.07.
    
    API Changes:
        - get_path, get_file, and get_directory now take a single named
          argument, "path", instead of a single un-named argument.

    Bugs Fixed:
        - Added tests for all the drivers, which fixed a lot of bugs. In short,
          don't use any version of VCI before this one.
    
    For VCI Developers:
        - If you set the VCI_TEST_DEBUG environment variable, it will be
          passed as the "debug" argument to VCI->connect, allowing you to
          see more information from the driver about what's going on in the
          test.
        - You can set VCI_REMOTE_TESTS = 1 in your environment to run
          tests that involve accessing machines over the Internet.
