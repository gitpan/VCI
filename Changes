0.1.0_2 Mon, Sep 3, 2007
    - 0.1.0_1 was completely broken for several drivers (couldn't connect
      to a Repository).
    - Various fixes to Diffs in various drivers (compared to 0.1.0_1).
    - Project objects now remove trailing and starting forward-slashes
      from their names when they are initialized. So "/project/" will be the
      same as "project".
    - Various POD fixes.
    - Doing "./Build dist" will now always run tests before building the
      distribution. This is necessary because running the tests properly
      sets up t/repos/ for distribution.
    - Added tests for Cvs, Svn, Git, and Bzr, which caused a lot of re-arch
      and various bug fixes:
    
    Svn:
        - Support for local repositories, including relative paths.
        - "time" on objects from get_path, get_file, and get_directory
          was wrong. (Svn returns microseconds and we were interpreting
          them as seconds.)
        - The 'R' action is now interepreted as the file being modified,
          not added and then deleted.
        - Properly strip the final newline from Commit::message.
        - Copied/moved files now handled correctly (and how they are
          handled is better documented).
        - File and Directory objects from other Projects won't show up
          in your Project's Commit objects.
    
    Cvs:
        - Support for local repositories, including relative paths.
        - Repository now supports "projects".
        - File and Directory objects now return the correct time if gotten
          from get_path, get_file, or get_directory.
        - We weren't passing the "-u" argument to cvsps, so the History
          wasn't being updated if there was a new commit to the repository
          since the very first time anybody ever called "history" on this
          project.
    
    Git:
        - Calling "contents" on a versioned Directory now correctly returns
          the contents of that Directory at that time in history.
        - Commit::message was always returning an empty string. It now
          correctly returns the message.
        - File objects now return their most recent revision instead of
          'HEAD' if you got them from get_path or get_file.
        - Support for relative paths to local repos.
        - Repository::projects now also detects "bare" repositories.
    
    Bzr:
        - Commit:message no longer has an extra space at the start or an
          extra newline at the end.

0.1.0_1 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Added "as_diff" to VCI::Abstract::Commit, and implemented it in all
      drivers. This allows you to get the actual changes done during
      the commit both as a raw diff from the VCS and as an object
      representing that diff.
    - Repository objects now fix "root" to end with a slash (if it doesn't
      already) on most VCSes, and fix it to *not* end with a slash on
      CVS.
    - Slightly improved debug output for Bzr.

0.0.2 Fri, Aug 31, 2007
    - Bzr's history and contents were broken.
    - Svn's history was broken.
    - Git driver had some debug code left in that was breaking history.

0.0.1 Tue, Aug 28, 2007
    - Support for CVS
    - Test::Warn was missing from build_requires
    - Cleaned up documentation
    - Committables now can never be created with just time and no revision.

0.0.0_1 Mon, Aug 27, 2007
    - Initial release, supporting Bzr, Svn, Hg, and Git
